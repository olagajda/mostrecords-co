MOST Records is a new label of PROSTO.
They needed a simple, pretty, yet fun website for promotion of their artists and albums.
The design consists of a few lines of text and video background switcher.
Every once in a while the website gets updated with a new set of videos.

Right now it's just one video, without the switcher.
